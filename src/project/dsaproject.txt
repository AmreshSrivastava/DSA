DSA projects in Java can help you solidify your understanding of data structures and algorithms while building practical applications. Here are a few ideas:
From creating Games to building Social Media Algorithms. DSA plays an integral part whether you want to build something of your own or either may be willing to get a job in big tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Netflix and more. 

Beginner Level:

Simple Data Structure Implementations:
Implement a linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, and hash table from scratch.
Build a basic sorting algorithm like bubble sort, insertion sort, or selection sort.

Number Guessing Game:
Use random number generation and binary search to implement a number guessing game.

Address Book:
Create a simple address book application to store and manage contacts.
Use a hash table or a tree to efficiently search for contacts.

To-do-list:

Intermediate Level:

Library Management System:
Build a system to manage books, patrons, and borrowing records.
Implement efficient searching and sorting for books and patrons.

Graph Algorithms:
Implement graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.
Solve problems like finding the shortest path (Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford algorithm) or detecting cycles.

Text Editor:
Create a simplified text editor with features like undo/redo, search, and replace.
Use a stack or a tree to implement undo/redo functionality.


Advanced Level:

Airline Reservation System:
Design a system for managing airline reservations, flight schedules, and seat assignments.
Use graphs to represent flight routes and algorithms for finding optimal routes.

Sudoku Solver:
Implement a Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithms.

Chess Engine:
Develop a chess engine that can play against human players.
Use tree-based algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best moves.


Important Considerations:
Test Thoroughly: Write unit tests to ensure your code is working correctly.
Optimize: Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithms and optimize them where possible.
Use a Version Control System: Use Git or another version control system to manage your codebase.
Document Your Code: Write clear and concise comments to explain your code.
